## ðŸ“– About this Project

It is pretty common for me to sync multiple devices. Also, it is a pain in the ass when I need to change to a different computer or format my own. On this repository, I'll centralize all my configuration files in order to allow an automated setup of my workstation.

## ðŸ¤– Getting Started
    
My dotfiles are managed by [fresh].

To install those, you need to run:
```
chmod +x ./setup.sh && ./setup.sh
```

Them, if you've installed the Fresh dotfiles manager, you can simply run:
```
fresh
```
