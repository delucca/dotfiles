## ðŸ“– About this Project

It is pretty common for me to sync multiple devices. Also, it is a pain in the ass when I need to change to a different computer or format my own. On this repository, I'll centralize all my configuration files in order to allow an automated setup of my workstation.

## ðŸ¤– Getting Started
    
My dotfiles are managed by [chezmoi].

After installing it, run the following command to apply my custom configurations to it:

```bash
ln -s ~/.dotfiles/configs/manual/chezmoi/chezmoi.toml ~/.config/chezmoi/chezmoi.toml
```

And them, finally, you can run the following: 

```bash
chezmoi apply
```

And all my dotfiles will be properly installed.
